# Python Portfolio

The projects I create whilst self-learning Python will be kept here. There will be a description of each project, which will explain what the code does, why I created the code, and how I have developed my Python skills throughout my learning.

## Football Goals Counter
### Skills Gained - SQLite, HTML, Tkinter, googlesearch, regular expressions
This is my first proper project in Python which has not been guided by an online course. I got the idea for this through my partner, who was using an Excel sheet to track the footbal players which he had seen score. This meant he was manually inputting a lot of information after every football game, and wasn't getting all the statistics that he would have liked. I therefore decided to test my Python skills and create him a programme which would aid him in this. 

This code has a user interface to aid the user inputting and viewing data. There is three pages to this programme. There is a home page, a page to add data, and a page to view statistics. On the page to add data, there is a box to use google search. The user inputs a date and football team and the code will search google to get statistics for this game. If it cannot find details about this game then advanced options are shown to allow the user to enter the data manually. This includes score, players scored, and the time that they scored, to aid in the statistics. The view statistics page has different options which allow the user to select what statistics is viewed. 

Overall, this project has taught me how to use Tkinter to provide a user interface, and how to Google Search with Python. It has also allowed me to develop my SQLite, HTML, and basic python skills, which I hope to show through the rest of my projects. There is still a lot of work to do with this project, and I hope to eventually make the UI nicer, but so far I am proud of how this project has gone.

## Varsity Code 2021
### Skills Gained - competitive programming, consideration for edge cases, regular expressions
This was my first time competing in a coding competition, so I have learnt a lot about competitive programming. It is also the first time I have been properly given a brief which I have to think of edge cases for, which I believe is making my programming better in the long run. It is allowing me to create programmes for scenarios which I otherwise wouldn't have thought of, which I am enjoying doing. I have also enjoyed seeing other people's solutions once each challenge has ended, as it has allowed me to see how I could have more efficiently programmed, which I will take forward for future code.

Each challenge has a range of private test cases which the code is tested against, to get a score for each challenge. I am competing for team UK, as my university was not available to sign up for. We are currently 8th in the leaderboard. I am 2nd in the leaderboard for team UK with an average of 46%. This folder will contain subsequent folders with the code for each challenge, and a description of each challenge.
