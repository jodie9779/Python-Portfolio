## Lloyds Banking Group Extra Challenges
### First competition I won

Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) set five extra challenges for anyone who wanted an extra challenge during their two weeks of Varsity Code. I completed all five challenges within the same day, and also aided the team in ironing out some bugs with a few of the challenges. I was really happy when I got the email to say I had come joint first, as this was the first coding challenge I had won! This has shown me that my self-learning in Python is paying off, and to continue with what I am doing.

There are five extra challenges which range from medium to hard difficulty, as rated by Lloyds.
