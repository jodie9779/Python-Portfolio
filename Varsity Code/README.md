## Varsity Code 2021
### Skills Gained - competitive programming, consideration for edge cases, regular expressions

This currently contains challenge 1, 2, 3 and 4. It also contains the 5 extra challenges from Lloyds Banking Group (LBG). I will update with future challenges once each challenge in completed.

This was my first time competing in a coding competition, so I have learnt a lot about competitive programming. It is also the first time I have been properly given a brief which I have to think of edge cases for, which I believe is making my programming better in the long run. It is allowing me to create programmes for scenarios which I otherwise wouldn't have thought of, which I am enjoying doing. I have also enjoyed seeing other people's solutions once each challenge has ended, as it has allowed me to see how I could have more efficiently programmed, which I will take forward for future code.

Each challenge has a range of private test cases which the code is tested against, to get a score for each challenge. I am competing for team UK, as my university was not available to sign up for. We are currently 8th in the leaderboard. I am 2nd in the leaderboard for team UK with an average of 64%. This folder will contain subsequent folders with the code for each challenge, and a description of each challenge.
